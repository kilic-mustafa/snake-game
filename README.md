# Snake Game


## Description
A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle Graphics library. This game simulates the fundamental mechanics of the popular Snake game where you control a snake to collect food (yellow circle), grow longer, and avoid colliding with your own tail.


## Features

- Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- Growing Snake: The snake grows each time it eats the food.
- Collision Detection: Game over if the snake collides with its own tail.
- Score Tracking: Displays the current score and the highest score achieved.
- Sound Effects: Includes sound effects for eating food and game-over scenarios.
- Smooth Game Loop: The game loop updates the game state and renders the changes smoothly.
